    We have conducted an experiment where a group of 40 participants performed
    3 different types of intellectual tasks (numerical, sequential, and verbal)
    while drawing circles with their dominant hand on a tablet during two minutes.
    For each task type there was an easy and a difficult variant, giving a total
    of 6 tasks per participant. Participants answered a questionnaire about effort
    and perceived difficulty. The data is in data-from-trials.xlsx, and the
    circle traces are in CSV files in input_files/.

    Which research questions could you answer with this data?
